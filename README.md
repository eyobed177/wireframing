# Wireframing

## 📌 Introduction

**Wireframing** is the process of creating a simplified visual representation of a user interface (UI). It serves as a blueprint or skeletal framework for the structure and functionality of a web page or application.

## 🎯 Purpose of Wireframing

Wireframes help designers, developers, and stakeholders:

- Visualize the layout of a page or screen.
- Identify key components such as navigation, content areas, and user interaction points.
- Communicate ideas clearly before moving to high-fidelity design or development stages.

## 💡 Importance in the Design Process

Wireframing is a crucial step in the UI/UX design process because it:

- Saves time and resources by catching usability issues early.
- Enhances collaboration between team members and clients.
- Allows for rapid iteration and feedback.
- Sets a clear foundation for user interface and user experience decisions.

## 🛠️ Tools Commonly Used

Some popular wireframing tools include:

- Figma
- Balsamiq
- Adobe XD
- Sketch
- Pen and paper (yes, even low-tech works!)
